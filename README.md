# password-generator

## Description

This is a web application that provides the user with a randomly generated password that meets their desired criteria while solving the problem of having to create a password that provides strong security to your private and important information. The goal was to create an application that could generate a random password equivalent to the number the user inputs. The password must meet 1 of 4 character criteria; must includee either uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or special characters. In this project, I am aiming to apply my newly acquired knowledge of javascript functions, conditional statements, for loops, methods, and manipulating the DOM.

## Usage

The page is loaded with a button and a UI to display the newly generated password.

Once the user clicks on the button they are prompted the enter in a number. The number must be longer than 8 characters in length but no more than 128 characters.

When the user enters a number between 8-128 the fun begins! They will then see a confirm box with the question 'Do you need Uppercase?' The user has the option to choose between uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. They can choose a random mixture of all four or just one criteria by itself (all symbols, all numbers, etc.) but the requirement is that they must choose at lease one category.

After the user clicks through the criteria the password is generated and displayed on the UI.

If the wish to include just one criteria the output will be

The user will see this screen if the number they have entered does not meet the minimum of 8 or maximum of 128.
